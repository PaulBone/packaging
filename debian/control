Description: Mercury programming language tools
 Mercury is a logic/functional programming language which combines the clarity
 and expressiveness of declarative programming with advanced static analysis
 and error detection features.
 .
 Its highly optimized execution algorithm delivers efficiency far in excess of
 existing logic programming systems, and close to conventional programming
 systems. Mercury addresses the problems of large-scale program development,
 allowing modularity, separate compilation, and numerous optimization/time
 trade-offs.
 .
 This package contains the compiler, debugging and profiling tools.
